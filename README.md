# Image Contest!

This is a sample ASP.NET Core application used to demonstrate just a few of the [many, many things you can do on Azure for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/free-account-faq/?WT.mc_id=devops-0000-dabrady)!

 - The free [Azure Pipelines](https://www.azure.com/pipelines/?WT.mc_id=devops-0000-dabrady) offering for Open Source projects
 - Azure [App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/?WT.mc_id=devops-0000-dabrady)
 - [Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/?WT.mc_id=devops-0000-dabrady) - specifically the [Bing Image Search API](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/bing-image-search-api/?WT.mc_id=devops-0000-dabrady)
- [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/monitor/?WT.mc_id=devops-0000-dabrady) (specifically [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights/app-insights-overview?WT.mc_id=devops-0000-dabrady))

And of course I used [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=devops-0000-dabrady) for all the dev work. Also free!!

## Ok but does it actually do?

Oh, right. It's a trivial app.

You enter some search terms, and the app will call the Bing Image Search API to get the *first* search result, and *another* result in the top 10. Your job is to pick the image that was the top result.

You get a point for each correct guess, and lose a point for guesses you get wrong.

Right now, there's no back-end data store or leaderboard. You'll just have to bask in the warm glow of your own success. Or failure.

## What do I do with this?

The app? Probably nothing.

However, we'll be releasing a <5min video soon showing how easy it is to put all the above technologies together - **for free** - to start building a nice DevOps story around this application. Everything from CI/CD to updates with no downtime, to monitoring in production!

## What if I find a bug!?

Don't worry - there are bugs, and they're meant to be there, so they probably won't be fixed.

Wow, as a developer, it's amazing to be able to say that.
